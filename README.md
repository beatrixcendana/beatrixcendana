- 🔭 I’m currently a looking for an opportunity as a **Content Designer** or **Tech Writer**. I was also a former community manager at [Bit Project](https://www.bitproject.org/), one of non profit organizations focusing on helping students that want to break into tech or STEM.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about ***SEO or Marketing*** and taking ***web development course in Freecodecamp***.
- 😄 Interest: learning new things (everything! Including automotive and digital products).
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her/hers 👸
- ⚡ Fun fact: 
   - I come from non-tech background, which is medical and graphic design field. 
   - I am also an Indonesian traditional dancer! 💃
   - Many people mentioned that I am IT person or CS person. But I am not! hahaha. I only have interest in taking my coding skills to the next level and it develops my interest in learning more about it. Even though I am bad at it, but I am just having fun creating something that is out of my expectation.
